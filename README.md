kavkaz
======

Mostly a personal exercise to learn the Armenian
and Georgian scripts. I don't actually know either
of the two languages minus a handful of words
and everything (including the word lists and
character transliteration) is generated with
ChatGPT.

usage
-----

```
Usage of ./kavkaz:
  -a    Armenian (default)
  -e    Amharic
  -g    Georgian
```

It's a quiz, guess the transliteration and you'll
get a new word. Write `?` for a reminder, easy
peasy.

issues
------

* Georgian transliteration isn't too far from
  standard.
* Armenian has some challenges and it's really
  more about learning the letters than how
  words are actually pronounced. Most ligatures
  are missing.
* Amharic (which I clearly added later given
  the name of the project) is very broken and
  currently useless unless one cheats.
